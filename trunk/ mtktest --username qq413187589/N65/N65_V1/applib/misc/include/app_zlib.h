     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio.

     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.

   The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has

   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
   opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller. If next_in is not Z_NULL and avail_in is large enough (the exact
   value depends on the compression method), inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  msg is set to null if there is no error
   message. inflateInit does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the zlib header if present: this will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and
   avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)
*/


ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflate OF((z_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may some
  introduce some output latency (reading input without producing any output)
  except when forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows. inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the flush parameter).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate(). If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, inflate flushes as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. The flushing behavior of inflate is
  not specified for values of the flush parameter other than Z_SYNC_FLUSH
  and Z_FINISH, but the current implementation actually flushes as much output
  as possible anyway.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

     If a preset dictionary is needed at this point (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm-adler to the adler32 checksum of the
  dictionary chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise 
  it sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all output produced
  so far (that is, total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or
  an error code as described below. At the end of the stream, inflate()
  checks that its computed adler32 checksum is equal to that saved by the
  compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect
  adler32 checksum), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent
  (for example if next_in or next_out was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
  enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not
  enough room in the output buffer when Z_FINISH is used. In the Z_DATA_ERROR
  case, the application may then call inflateSync to look for a good
  compression block.
*/

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit2 OF((z_streamp strm,
                                     int  windowBits));

     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter. The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library. The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead. If a compressed stream with a larger window size is given as
   input, inflate() will return with the error code Z_DATA_ERROR instead of
   trying to allocate a larger window.

      inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as a negative
   memLevel). msg is set to null if there is no error message.  inflateInit2
   does not perform any decompression apart from reading the zlib header if
   present: this will be done by inflate(). (So next_in and avail_in may be
   modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)
