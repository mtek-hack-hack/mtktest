 * Fix Bug #1885 CANNON PLUS: 
 *    This is a button update bug during button press down and up, a state change overwrites the selected button value
 *    to cause button update wrong after button up.
 *    I fixed it by forcing to release button after any state change to overwrite the selected button value
 * 
 * Fix Bug #1928 CANNON PLUS:
 *    When repeat mode is "ONE", play a short file since it is too short so it keeps repeat playing and no other command can be taken.
 *    I solved it by applying pre-check button down condition whenever play completed and ready to play next song.
 *    Thus, a STOP, PREV, or NEXT button down event is processed in higher priority than play completed event.
 *    Therefore, they won't be blocked by repeating short file.
